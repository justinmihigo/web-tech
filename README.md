# Introduction:
Pediatric Growth Track is a transformative project aimed at addressing a critical issue in child healthcare in Rwanda. With a focus on the holistic well-being of children,
this initiative is designed to help parents and caregivers track the growth, vaccination, and overall health of their children. In a country where the under-5 mortality rate
has seen significant improvements but remains a concern, Pediatric Growth Track seeks to empower parents with the tools and knowledge they need to ensure the health and longevity
of their little ones.
# Problem Statement:
Rwanda has made remarkable progress in reducing child mortality rates, as evidenced by the data from the World Bank. In 1990, the under-5 mortality rate stood at a staggering 156 deaths per 1,000 live births. While substantial progress has been made, the current rate of 58 deaths per 1,000 live births still means that approximately 5.8% of children born in Rwanda do not survive to see their fifth birthday. While this is an improvement, there is still much work to be done to further reduce this rate and ensure the well-being of Rwanda’s children.
The problem at hand is multi-faceted:
1. Lack of Awareness and Education: Many parents and caregivers in Rwanda may not have access to the information they need to ensure proper child growth, vaccination schedules, and overall health monitoring. This knowledge gap can result in delayed or missed vaccinations, inadequate nutrition, and untimely medical interventions.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare: In some regions of Rwanda, access to healthcare facilities and qualified medical professionals can be limited. This can lead to difficulties in accessing timely medical care and advice for parents seeking to monitor their child’s health.
3. Data Tracking Challenges: Keeping track of a child’s growth, vaccinations, and health records can be challenging for busy parents and caregivers. The lack of a streamlined and accessible system makes it difficult to maintain accurate records and adhere to vaccination schedules.

# Proposed Solution:
Pediatric Growth Track aims to mitigate these challenges by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for parents and caregivers. Through this initiative, we will:
1. Educate and Empower: We will provide parents and caregivers with valuable information about child growth, vaccination schedules, and overall health through user-friendly interfaces and educational content. This will empower them to make informed decisions about their child’s well-being.
2. Access to Healthcare Resources: Pediatric Growth Track will collaborate with healthcare providers and institutions to facilitate access to healthcare services. Telemedicine and remote consultations will be incorporated into the platform to bridge the gap in healthcare access.
3. Streamlined Data Management: Our platform will offer a secure and easily accessible system for parents to track their child’s growth, vaccinations, and health records. Automated reminders for vaccination schedules and growth assessments will ensure timely interventions.
Certainly, let’s set a specific target for the Pediatric Growth Track project:
# Target:
Our primary goal with the Pediatric Growth Track project is to significantly reduce the under-5 mortality rate in Rwanda. While the current rate stands at 5.8%, we aim to achieve a substantial decrease and set an ambitious target of reducing this rate to 2% within the next five years.
